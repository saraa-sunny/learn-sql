# ⭐ Learn SQL - Notes & Practice Questions  

Hi! Welcome to my SQL learning repo 👋    

When I first started learning SQL, I struggled to understand tables, joins, and figure out what the output would actually look like. I’d read tutorials, try queries somewhere, and then lose track of everything.
That’s exactly why I made this repo: a single place to document everything I learn, step by step.  

**Here, you’ll find notes, examples, exercises, and a roadmap from beginner to advanced topics.**  

Learn, practice, and explore SQL while having a little fun along the way! 🌞 

⚠️ This repo is still in progress. I’ve completed a few topics so far and will continue adding notes, examples, and exercises as I learn.

## 📝 SQL Practice Problems
Alongside these notes, I actively practice SQL problems to solidify my understanding.   
Check out my SQL Practice Questions repo for exercises and solutions: [sql-practice-questions](https://github.com/saraa-sunny/sql-practice-questions)  
This helps me apply the concepts I learn and tackle queries similar to real-world product analytics questions.
