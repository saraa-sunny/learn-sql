## SQL 
SQL stands for Structured Query Language.  

SQL is a standard language for interacting with RDBMS. It allows you to:
* Create and maintain database structures such as tables.
* Insert, update, and delete data.
* Retrieve data from tables.


SQL consists of three main parts:
* Data definition language (DDL) deals with the database structure creation and modification.
CREATE TABLE, ALTER TABLE, and DROP TABLE

* Data manipulation language (DML) provides statements to query data, such as the SELECT statement, and modify the data like INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE statements.
  
* Data control language (DCL) includes statements, working with user authorization and security, such as GRANT and REVOKE statements.
